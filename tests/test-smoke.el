;;; test-smoke.el --- Ultra-fast smoke tests -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Critical smoke tests that must pass before running full test suite.
;; These tests should complete in under 1 second total.
;; No heavy loading, no filesystem operations, no package loading.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

;;; Emacs Environment
